A child starting preschool, approaches a major milestone with conflicting emotions about his/her transition of venturing out into the world without parents around, proud about being a big boy/girl but worried about being separated from them and starting something unfamiliar at the same time.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
<strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong> is a preschool, that helps smoothen this transition by focusing on the 3 E’s- <strong>"Enrich, Energize and Evolve"</strong>, thus moulding a child’s budding mind to achieve social & emotional development.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
<strong>Enrich - </strong>From the time a child is born to the time he enters preschool, he spends an average of 800 days soaking in pieces of information from various sources. At <strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong>, we believe in providing an environment that further enriches a receptive mind to put the pieces together.

At <strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong>, we believe that childhood is not a race to see how quickly a child can read, write and count, but it is a small window of time to learn and evolve at a pace that is right for each individual child.

      <h3 class="text-center pt10">Introduction</h3>

              
              <p class="text-justify">Children are born ready to learn and understand the world around them. It is natural for them to use all their abilities to learn. From birth, children are learning about themselves, other people and the world around them, playing an active role in their own learning and development.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">The first 2 to 6 years of a child’s life are globally acknowledged to be the most critical years for lifelong development, since the pace of development in these years is extremely rapid. Recent research in the field of neuroscience, provided convincing evidence of the ‘critical periods’ located within these early years for the forming of synaptic connections in the brain and for the full development of the brain’s potential. Research has also indicated that if these early years are not supported by or embedded in, a stimulating and enriching physical and psychosocial environment, the chances of the child’s brain developing to its full potential are considerably, often irreversible and reduced.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">This stage in life is also important as a foundation for the inculcation of social values and personal habits, which are known to last a lifetime.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">What follows logically is the crucial importance of investing in these early years to ensure an enabling environment for every child and thereby a sound foundation for life, which is not only the right of every child but which will also impact in the long term the quality of human capital available to a country.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">
           We may categorize learning in the early years in many ways, but whatever may be the categories, it is important for people who work and live with children, to keep in mind the broad range of kinds of learning that are important in the early years. Some important areas of learning are listed below.

            </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">
            Early Childhood Care and Education Policy by Government of India (Proposed) - aims at providing integrated services for the holistic development of all children from the prenatal period to six years. It lays down the way forward for a comprehensive approach towards ensuring a sound foundation for every child.
            </p>

             <p class="text-justify">
             Broadly, the policy focuses on re-structuring the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme and integrating early childhood education to ensure a smooth transition into formal schooling. It believes, Pre-primary education is not a downward extension of primary education and hence a holistic one. It needs to be based on the developmental approach rather than a mere educational approach.

				<h4>About Us</h4>

                <p class="text-justify">
A child starting preschool, approaches a major milestone with conflicting emotions about his/her transition of venturing out into the world without parents around, proud about being a big boy/girl but worried about being separated from them and starting something unfamiliar at the same time.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
<strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong> is a preschool, that helps smoothen this transition by focusing on the 3 E’s- <strong>"Enrich, Energize and Evolve"</strong>, thus moulding a child’s budding mind to achieve social & emotional development.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
<strong>Enrich - </strong>From the time a child is born to the time he enters preschool, he spends an average of 800 days soaking in pieces of information from various sources. At <strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong>, we believe in providing an environment that further enriches a receptive mind to put the pieces together.

<strong>Energize</strong> “Minds are like parachutes, they only function when they are open.” - <strong class="text-blue">James Dewar</strong>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
At <strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong>, we believe in providing children with an environment that helps them learn as they play, thus energizing their minds.

<strong>Evolve</strong> “The goal of early childhood education should be to activate the child’s own natural desire to learn.” - <strong class="text-blue">Maria Montessori</strong>
</p>

<p>
At <strong>EDU-PAEDIA</strong>, we believe that childhood is not a race to see how quickly a child can read, write and count, but it is a small window of time to learn and evolve at a pace that is right for each individual child.

				<h4>Concept Note</h4>

                <h3 class="text-center pt10">Introduction</h3>

              
              <p class="text-justify">Children are born ready to learn and understand the world around them. It is natural for them to use all their abilities to learn. From birth, children are learning about themselves, other people and the world around them, playing an active role in their own learning and development.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">The first 2 to 6 years of a child’s life are globally acknowledged to be the most critical years for lifelong development, since the pace of development in these years is extremely rapid. Recent research in the field of neuroscience, provided convincing evidence of the ‘critical periods’ located within these early years for the forming of synaptic connections in the brain and for the full development of the brain’s potential. Research has also indicated that if these early years are not supported by or embedded in, a stimulating and enriching physical and psychosocial environment, the chances of the child’s brain developing to its full potential are considerably, often irreversible and reduced.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">This stage in life is also important as a foundation for the inculcation of social values and personal habits, which are known to last a lifetime.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">What follows logically is the crucial importance of investing in these early years to ensure an enabling environment for every child and thereby a sound foundation for life, which is not only the right of every child but which will also impact in the long term the quality of human capital available to a country.</p>
			
              

                           

             
                           

             <h3 class="text-center pt10">Making the most of childhood - the importance of the early years</h3>
            
          <p class="text-justify">
           We may categorize learning in the early years in many ways, but whatever may be the categories, it is important for people who work and live with children, to keep in mind the broad range of kinds of learning that are important in the early years. Some important areas of learning are listed below.

Early Years Education in India - the present scenario:

            </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">
            Early Childhood Care and Education Policy by Government of India (Proposed) - aims at providing integrated services for the holistic development of all children from the prenatal period to six years. It lays down the way forward for a comprehensive approach towards ensuring a sound foundation for every child.
            </p>

             <p class="text-justify">
             Broadly, the policy focuses on re-structuring the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme and integrating early childhood education to ensure a smooth transition into formal schooling. It believes, Pre-primary education is not a downward extension of primary education and hence a holistic one. It needs to be based on the developmental approach rather than a mere educational approach.

               At Edu-Paedia, our Preschool curriculum is based on current research in early brain development, early childhood education and developmental psychology. Through careful observation we can assure that individual developmental needs are being met. The Program is a flexible, yet structured program designed to enable your child to explore and grow in their ever changing world. The program consists of short, structured activities where your child explores and learns while improving their fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and social skills. The Program is age-appropriate, geared to the individual needs of each child and offered in a warm and caring environment.

              The Kindergarten curriculum is divided into four areas: <strong>Language & Literacy~ Creative Express~ Science & Sensory Gross Motor Skills</strong>. The fifth area Emotional Intelligence/Social Studies is taught whenever the opportunity arises and also specifically and deliberately in all of the other curriculum areas. Each curriculum area offers a different style of learning, appropriate materials and equipment, alternates between child-initiated and teacher-directed activities. They are all integrated with the thematic approach and coordinated lesson planning.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
              The four curriculum areas are taught by teacher(s), in classrooms specifically designed and equipped for each subject. The children are in a cohesive group, enjoying relationships with one another for the school year and have the advantages of utilizing specialized classroom as well as the outdoor play.

All activities, of course, are age appropriate and emphasize 'process' rather than 'product'.
