      </h3>

              
              <p class="text-justify">Children are born ready to learn and understand the world around them. It is natural for them to use all their abilities to learn. From birth, children are learning about themselves, other people and the world around them, playing an active role in their own learning and development.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">The first 2 to 6 years of a child’s life are globally acknowledged to be the most critical years for lifelong development, since the pace of development in these years is extremely rapid. Recent research in the field of neuroscience, provided convincing evidence of the ‘critical periods’ located within these early years for the forming of synaptic connections in the brain and for the full development of the brain’s potential. Research has also indicated that if these early years are not supported by or embedded in, a stimulating and enriching physical and psychosocial environment, the chances of the child’s brain developing to its full potential are considerably, often irreversible and reduced.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">This stage in life is also important as a foundation for the inculcation of social values and personal habits, which are known to last a lifetime.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">What follows logically is the crucial importance of investing in these early years to ensure an enabling environment for every child and thereby a sound foundation for life, which is not only the right of every child but which will also impact in the long term the quality of human capital available to a country.</p>

           We may categorize learning in the early years in many ways, but whatever may be the categories, it is important for people who work and live with children, to keep in mind the broad range of kinds of learning that are important in the early years.

               At Edu-Paedia, our Preschool curriculum is based on current research in early brain development, early childhood education and developmental psychology. Through careful observation we can assure that individual developmental needs are being met. The Program is a flexible, yet structured program designed to enable your child to explore and grow in their ever changing world. The program consists of short, structured activities where your child explores and learns while improving their fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and social skills. The Program is age-appropriate, geared to the individual needs of each child and offered in a warm and caring environment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify post">
                The children are involved with a specific set of teachers and can enjoy a variety of activities in their company. We make sure that we maintain program flexibility because these early years mean rapidly changing needs as each child grows through many stages of development. Our curriculum addresses all areas of development. We do this by carefully planning and coordinating five areas:

              The Kindergarten curriculum is divided into four areas: <strong>Language & Literacy~ Creative Express~ Science & Sensory Gross Motor Skills</strong>. The fifth area Emotional Intelligence/Social Studies is taught whenever the opportunity arises and also specifically and deliberately in all of the other curriculum areas. Each curriculum area offers a different style of learning, appropriate materials and equipment, alternates between child-initiated and teacher-directed activities. They are all integrated with the thematic approach and coordinated lesson planning.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
              The four curriculum areas are taught by teacher(s), in classrooms specifically designed and equipped for each subject. The children are in a cohesive group, enjoying relationships with one another for the school year and have the advantages of utilizing specialized classroom as well as the outdoor play.

              At <strong>'Edu-Paedia'</strong> our goal is to create an environment where there is respect for age, gender and cultural differences. Themes are introduced every month with weekly sub themes to help the children discover the similarities as well as the differences among ourselves and others.

              In each of our Kinder garten classrooms, learning centers are set up to encourage your child to make choices while developing social, fine motor, gross motor, pre-reading, writing and communication skills. Your child will be exposed to exciting new experiences while exploring a variety of learning materials and participating in many interesting projects. All activities, of course, are age appropriate and emphasize 'process' rather than 'product'.

               A hobby is defined as an activity that engages a child for a long time and the child finds self-satisfaction in doing the same. As he enjoys working on it, it becomes a part of him. As it keeps him happy, he loves to take it up again and again.
